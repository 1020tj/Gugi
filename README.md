# Gugi
The Gugi was named with the feeling that the font design reminds us of a ball playing after completion of the project. 
The name Gugi means ball game in Korean. 
Gugi font is a experimental headline font based on the Hunminjengum(the first Hangul design principle textbook) and ball image. 
The design is based on unbalanced strokes. We have deliberately deleted or transformed the horizontal strokes of vowels like ㅗ,ㅛ and some consonents Like ㅆ,ㅃ,ㅉ. and borrowed some stroke design from Hunminjengum.
with releasing Gugi as a open source font, we are expecting lots of variations of it. Also we are considering design more derivative fonts with Gugi.
